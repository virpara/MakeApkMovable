## MakeApkMovable ##
It modifies any apk and makes them installable on SD card.

## How it works ##
It changes value of the attribute "android:installLocation" to "preferExternal" in the AndroidManifest.xml file of the apk
which allows the application to be installed on SD card.

## Why do I need this ##
My mobile has only 5 GB of internal memory and I cannot move the applications to SD card because some apps do not allow it.
There are consequences of using this, but I don't mind them. :)
